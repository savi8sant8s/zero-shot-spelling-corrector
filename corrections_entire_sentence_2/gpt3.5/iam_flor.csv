"Mind is at hand ! "" He turned beaming eyes"
upward and shook his head slowly from
a superfluous precaution for there was no other car
abroad; and no pedestrian to cross his path nor to wait
at an intersection for the light to change. At his
apartment he garaged his car and then stood
listening in the night. Listening in vain. For the
"earth had lost its life-tempo, as the heart"
"Deadly stillness, deadly portent!"
Sterne awakened early and switched on
"the radio, which he kept tuned to CB0."
The set lighted-up but gave only a low
buzzing sound. He had just finished
"shaving when it came on, with a flat"
"voice repeating: ""This is 3c calling"
"c calling..."""
"if ever what had reamed an unchre period of repetition, the voice"
went on to describe the launching of the Thetan colony
"in Jussex, in all its obscene details. Then the radio"
"went clear again, and there had no stomach for"
"treatfest. It was a beautiful day, as firsts-of ' Jure"
should be. Here got out the car and traversed the
"same empty streets as he had the night before,"
to keep an appointment with Heather.
Coming around the great mass of the Ch√¢teau
"tamier, he brake to a screeching stop. A"
flying saucer was tilting and dipping over
the war Memorial. There was a deep
"whining sound, and a high-pitched hissing"
overture that sang in his ears with an
almost painful sharpness. He reversed and
"turned back on Mr. Kengie Avenue,"
"""The Thetans,"" he said, ""are presumably here to"
"take charge, as it were, of the minds of the"
people-who are probably falling all over them-
selves in their zeal to get their orders and to carry
"them out. Just what these orders will be, we don't"
"know. Now, because of prior hypnotists we have es-"
caped thetan subjugation. This time. But we no
longer have any immunity.
There can be little doubt that if the
Thetainr discover our mental independence
they will probably give us their hypnotic
treatment. If we can avoid undue
"prominence, it may be that we can"
move about pretty freely without
"detections. It can be - well, then we"
may be able to promote our
interests. What those interests
"are, beyond personal secrets,"
"I haven't a clue; but, who knows,"
we may form the nucleus around...
"""Now to summarize what I think our"
course of action should be. First to avoid the
"Thetans like the plague, for they must not"
"find us out; second, to tread pretty warily"
"among our own people, finding out just how"
much freedom we can take with safety.
"And third, to study these damned Thetans."
We must learn all we can about
There is just a hope that we may uncover
"some weakness, and find a way of fighting"
"back at them. ""Heather agreed, and suggested"
that they use Dan as a specimen demonstrating
how the thetan machinations had been
working out. It occurred to Steve that this may
not have been entirely an objective suggestion
on her part; but he thought it a good idea
So they proceeded to see if the coast
was clear. The street was quiet and
deserted and there were neither sight
nor sound of flying saucers so they
ventured forth and made their way on
foot to Dan's house. Dan came
to the door at their ring but neglected
to offer any greeting. He was deeply
"preoccupied, and it seemed that the"
ringing of a doorbell was to him
a new and strange phenomenon -
"When he finally beckoned to them to enter, the action"
gave the impression of having been thought out and
"decided upon. Inside they sat down unbidden, while"
Dan paced the floor. He seemed completely unaware
"of their presence. They just stared at him, turning"
their heads like tennis spectators as he walked up and
His whole attitude was a mixture of
impatience pending an awaited
communication and of a vague
perplexity respecting his surroundings
and the purpose he was to serve.

Heather and Steve tried to make themselves
at home. Steve switched on Jan's

"But not for long, for soon pedestrians and cars flocked upon"
the Avenue from its many tributary streets. It might have
"been a normal business-day bustle, except for two anomalies."
"First, it was Sunday morning, and, second, everyone"
"watched, or drove, or waited as a person possessed of"
a single all-exclusive purpose.

to come over and make the presentation in her stead.

But is the life of a naval officer's wife.
John's father had been a naval officer of the old
school; some of his rigid ideas had been passed
on to the second generation. One of these was that
"an officer should join a ship, on taking up a"
"new appointment, at nine a.m. precisely, dressed"
in the modern equivalent of frock-coat and sword.
But would have been acceptable to all concerned
if John had stepped into Fort Blockhouse clad in
"plain-clothes on the previous night, but ways"
instilled by martinet parents have a habit of
"So he put up for the night at The Admiral's Head, that"
"famous Portsmouth hostelry, second only in historic"
"interest to The George, unhappily destroyed by German"
bombs during the last war. Having deposited his
"luggage and parked his overnight-bag, he"
went in search of a drink. The lower bar was
"empty, save for the lady known by all habitues"
man who was staring moodily into a gin
Seaneed's memory was prodigious; her manner
must have been worth a great deal to the proprietors
"of the hotel. She greeted John, however, with less"
than her usual cordiality and flashed a warning
glance at him. Evidently the other occupant
of the bar was not persona grata. If her
"money was good, so was this stranger's."
"""You're Commander Winter,"" he said. ""Have a"
"gin?"" He turned to Seaneed-"
"""Make it a large one, darling. I knew the naval"
"halits."" Prink epin and call each other wallalus,"
"what!"" as the Euardsofficer said on his return"
"from a visit to the Rayal Nary. Submarines, what."
"Youngest D.S.C. in the war, what? Cranked"
inside a submarine casing to defuse a Jerry
bomb. Should have been a U.C.
"What are you waiting for, darling? The officer is"
"obviously thirsty."" John fought back his"
"inherited desire to snub the man. If he did, he"
would have to leave the bar and either sit in
the lounge or return to his bedroora.
Seaweed sensed his embarrassment and
"came to the rescue. ""You haven't introduced"
"yourself,"" she said with mild severity."
"""It's a sudden these premises. No treating with"
"strangeness -that's right -Jalm, in't it?"" ""My"

"He held out his hand, and John could not do"
"otherwise than take it. ""Pleased to meet you,"
"Commander,"" he said. ""Now what about that"

"one in return, and he was lonely."
"""For the sake of accuracy,"" he said, 'and I know"
how you newspaper value that commodity! -

lying in pairs alongside the jetty at Ford Blockhouse.
Black and grimly business till they both looked and

charged their electric batteries.
A light wind carried the smoke of diesel exhaust in
through the open windows of the Captain's house. It
pervaded every room but neither Harry nor Madeleine

"to experience such catastrophes as the loss of a submarine,"

This is the testing time for all. The affair blows up into

must present an unmelfled appearance and carry on as

I saw several men running down towards
the shack. They were all armed with rifles
As the nearest of them came round the

"came up close, eyeing us suspiciously. ""We've"

you may as well stay a while.
"Light and come on in. "" We dismounted and"
one of the miners who'd come along with
Nick Noud took our horses off the water
We followed Nick wound into the shack.
They had rigged up a store of sorts and on it
a huge blackened coffee-pot steamed. Other
miners followed in at our heels. Nick Doud
found us a couple of boxes to sit on.
A small man in bib overalls and a battered
"Derby hat fussed around the stove. ""Ain't"
exactly the Rite Hotel but we've got our little
"comforts,"" said Boud. He introduced the men"
"who'd come in as Roper Smith, Shorty, Mick"
"Golightly, Swede, and Sodbuster. This last was"
the little hombre in big overalls. Very soon he
had tin mugs filled with hot black coffee
sweetened with molasses for all and for us
there were two plates of beans.
"""They gives you the wind,"" said the Sodbuster"
"handing them to us, ""but it's all we got"
"as of now, apart from a few sacks of gold"
"dust."" He winked at his partners. They all"
watched us as we ate the beans. Then when
we'd finished and I'd rolled a cigarette
"the man called Shorty said, ""You were saying when"
you came in that Esomep n happened last
"""Yes,"" I said. ""Something happened all right."""
"After you'd left the meeting, mister-"" I"
"looked across at Nick Sowd- ""someone cut"
down William Appleton outside the Palace
"with a shotgun."" I paused and watched my"
words affect them in their different ways.
"""That's sure bad news,"" said Doud, somberly."
"""It just about leaves everything wide open"
"for Mr. Pell and his bunch,"" observed"
The rest of the men there said nothing but
you could see they were hard at it. They were
simple men who knew a lot maybe about
digging for gold but were babes in arms
when it came to dealing with outshooters and
desperadoes like Pell and Fenton and the
"rest. ""I guess we'd better hold onto the gold"
"right hyar, Nick,"" said the Sodbuster."
"""Yeah,"" said Dowd dubiously. ""Maybe we'd"
"better."" Surprisingly Dan Mattney came in at"
"that point. ""If you do,"" he said, ""you'll be"
sure asking for trouble. They'll be on your
necks before you can say 'knife.' It wouldn't
be the first time they've held up a diggings
at gunpoint either. They've done it before
"and got away with it."""
"""You're darned tootin', mister,"" said the man"
called Roper Smith. 'We're got five rifles among
us and a few six-shooters. But most of us
ain't educated in shootin'. It'd be a
"massacre, excess. ""If you'll take a chance"
"on getting your gold to the bank, then we'll"
"abide by what we said at the meeting,"""
"said Dan. ""We'll watch the stage out of reach."""
I couldn't quite see how all this fitted in
with Dan Maffrey's aim to avenge himself
on the Fenton bunch but still it was a
"handsome offer so I chimed in too. ""That"
"goes for me, gentlemen,"" I said. ""If they do try"
"and hold up the stage, it'll be a couple or"
"three of them, no more. I reckon we can deal"

went quickly back to fetch them.
Gavin and the girl who had got
off the plane with him were talking.
He was writing something in his
"pocket-book, with a such feeling"
of despair Gay knew that of course
"Gay, sitting opposite Gavin on the terrace could"
"hardly believe that she was the same girl,"
"miserable, shy, who had sat at the little"
table for the first time a few days ago.
Gavin raised his glass to her and smiled
and Gay's leaf turned over. 'I'd like

now Gavin was in love with her & her

"All that was part of the past, she would put it behind her. She"
"would never be jealous again, would even take Larry's advice and"

Gay touched him and walked out and to
the terrace thinking that perhaps Gavin
had bought a drink and taken it outside.
"Ahl looked round scanning the tables,"
