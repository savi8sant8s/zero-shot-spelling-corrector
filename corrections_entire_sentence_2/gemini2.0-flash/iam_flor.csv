"Mind is at hand ! "" He turned beaming eyes"
upward and shook his head slowly from
a superfluos precantion for there was no other car
obroad ; and no pedestrian to cross his path nor to wait
at an intersedia for the light to change . At his
apartment he garaged his car and then stood
listening in the night . Listening in vain . For the
"earth had lost its life- tempo , as the heart"
"Deadly stillness, deadly portent!"
Steve awakened early and switched on
"the radio, which he kept tuned to CBQ."
The set lighted-up but gave only a low
buzzing sound. He had just finished
"shaving when it came on, with a flat"
"voice repeating: ""This is 3C calling"
"3C calling. . . """
"If for what seemed an unearthly period of repetition, the voice"
went on to describe the launching of the Thetan colony
"in Sussex, in all its obscene details. Then the radio"
"went dead again, and there had no stomach for"
"breakfast. It was a beautiful day, as firsts-of-June"
should be. He got out the car and traversed the
"same empty streets as he had the night before,"
to keep an appointment with Heather.
Coming around the great mass of the Chatean
"tamier , he baket to a screeching stop . A"
flying sancer was tilting and dipping over
the was Memorial . There was a deep
"whining sound , and a high-pitched hising"
overtoue that sang in his ears with an
almost pain ful sharpness . He reversed and
"turned backe on Mr Kengie Avenue ,"
""" The Thetans , "" he said , "" are presumably here to"

""" Now to summarize what I think ovr"
course of action should be . First to avoid the
"Thetans like the plague , for they must not"
"find us out' second , to tread pretty warily"
"among our own people , finding out juot how"
huch freedon we can take with sefety .
"And third , to study these danned Thetans ."

There is just a lope that we may uncover
"some weakness , and find a way of fighing"
"back at them . "" Heather agreed , and suggested"
that they use Dan as a specimen demonsha-
ting how the thetan machinations had been
working out . It sccured to Steve that this may
not have been enthely an abjlective suggestion
on her part ; but he thought it a good ider
So they proceeded to see if the coast
was clear . The street was quiet and
deserted and there were neither sight
nor sound of flying saucers so they
ventured forth and made their way on
foot to Dan's house . Dan came
to the door at their ring but neglected
to offer any greeting . He was deeply
"preoccupied , and it seemed that the"
ringing of a doorbell was to him
a new and strange phenomuenon -
"When he finally beckoned to them to enter , the action"
gave the impression of having been thought out and
"decided upon . Inside they sat down usbiddes , while"
Dan paced the flour . He seemed completely unaware
"of their precence . They just stared at him , turning"
their heads like ternis spectators as he walked up and
His whole attitude was a mixture of
impatience pending an awaited
communication and of a vague
perplexity respecting his surrourdings
and the purpose he was to serve .
"Finally , being so obriously on their oun ,"
Heather and sleve tried to make themselves
at home . Steve switched on Jan's

"he waited . The lwr , stop was a deserted island on a eupty street ."
"But nd for long , for scompedectrians and cars flocked upon"
the Avenue from its many tribumary streets . It might have
"been a normal business-day bustle , except for two anomalies ."
"First , it was Sunday morning , and , second , everyone"
"wathed , or drove , or waited as a person possessed of"
a single all-exclusive pupose .
After a long wait a bus appeared and they

Mostorir was a buchelon M his life he had
been viclined to regurd Nomen as something
Which must necessarily be subordinated to his

"his own wife , but Geoffrey 'sas well , to a strange gil"
whom he had never met and on whom after no more
than a couple of tlephone calls he was
prepared to place compule reliance
It was a novel experience. Hlastar was
quite unable to explain why he should feel
so much confidence in her. Once again
she checked back her instructions. It was
obvious that she did not fail to appreciate the
faith which he was placing in her and
was prepared to accept the responsibility.

For some reason the orderlies had forgotten
to switch on the lights; there was no colour-
phapical features were distinguishable solely by
gradations of silvery greyness. Even the snow-
"capped summit of Mont Blanc, seven miles"
"below, was not recognisable among the list"
of lower peaks. The screen of the air-to-air
radar glowed. Occasionally minute spots
"flickered across its surface, but there was"
In the exceptional clarity he was even able to
make a direct comparison between the radar
image and the ground itself. Ahead lay the
"Plain of Lombardy; to the right, Turin; to the"
"left, Milan. The directional angle of the"
scanner could be adjusted to cover any
"particular area within its range, Geoffrey"
turned the scale slowly to cover the
ground immediately ahead.
"He was able to pick out towns , unrecognitable to the"
"naked eye , odscured by the groand hate which even"
on the clearest night limited angular vision . He glanced
at the speed recorder . It seemed almost incredible that
the ting white figure of 8.5 against which the needte
was resting could really mean hundreds of knots .

of the journey back to the place where every

Geoffrey set himself to consider the
movements of the Prentley. It had passed
him at the temporary bridge over the
Tartaro at a few minutes past ten on the
previous night. He worked out the distance
on the presumption that its route had been
through Florence and Rome and then
across Italy via Foggia to Barletta.

to come over and make the presentution in her staad .

John's father had been a naval officer of the old
