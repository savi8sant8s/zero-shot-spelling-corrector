Steve awakened early and switched on
"the radio, which he kept tuned to CB0."
The set lighted up but gave only a low

"same empty streets as he had the night before ,"
to keep an appointment with Heather .
Coming around the great mass of the Chateau
"tamier, he braked to a screeching stop. A"
flying saucer was tilting and dipping over
the War Memorial. There was a deep
"whining sound, and a high-pitched hissing"

that they use Dan as a specimen demon-
strating how the thetan machinations had been
working out. It seemed to Steve that this may
not have been entirely an objective suggestion
on her part; but he thought it a good idea
So they proceeded to see if the coast
was clear. The street was quiet and
deserted and there were neither sight
nor sound of flying saucers so they
ventured forth and made their way on
foot to Dan's house. Dan came
to the door at their ring but neglected
to offer any greeting. He was deeply
"preoccupied, and it seemed that the"
ringing of a doorbell was to him
a new and strange phenomuenon -
"When he finally beckoned to them to enter, the action"
gave the impression of having been thought out and
"decided upon. Inside they sat down side by side, while"
Dan paced the floor. He seemed completely unaware
"of their presence. They just stared at him, turning"
their heads like tennis spectators as he walked up and
His whole attitude was a mixture of
impatience pending an awaited
communication and of a vague
perplexity respecting his surroundings
and the purpose he was to serve .

"But not for long, for scampering pedestrians and cars flocked upon"
the Avenue from its many tributary streets. It might have
"been a normal business-day bustle, except for two anomalies."
"First, it was Sunday morning, and, second, everyone"
"watched, or drove, or waited as a person possessed of"
a single all-exclusive purpose.

But is the life of a naval officer's wife.
John's father had been a naval officer of the old
school; some of his rigid ideas had been passed
on to the second generation. One of these was that
"an officer should join a ship, on taking up a"
"new appointment, at nine am. precisely, dressed"
in the modern equivalent of frock-coat and sword.
But it would have been acceptable to all concerned
if John had stepped into Fort Blockhouse clad in
"plain-clothes on the previous night, but ways"
instilled by martinet parents have a habit of

went in search of a drink . The lower bar was

Seaneed's memory was prodigious; her manner
must have been worth a great deal to the proprietors
"of the hat. She greeted John, however, with less"
than her usual cordiality and flashed a warning
glance at him. Evidently the other occupant
of the bar was not persona grata. If her
"money was good, so was this stranger's"
"""You're Commander Winter,"" he said. 'Have a"
"gin?"" He turned to Seaneed -"
""" Make it a large one , darling . I knew the naval"

"What are you waiting for, darling? The officer is"
"obviously thirsty. "" John fought back his"
inherited desire to snub the man. If he did he
would have to leave the bar and either sit in

An hour's ride brought us to a trail that
we thought would lead to the miners' camp .

"came up close, eyeing us suspiciously. ""We've"

you may as well stay a while.
"Light and come on in. "" We dismounted and"
one of the miners who'd come along with
Nick Noud took our horses to the water
We followed Nick Noud into the shack .
They'd rigged up a store of sorts and on it
a huge blackened coffee-pot steamed . Other
miners followed in at our heels . Nick Noud
found us a couple of boxes to sit on .
A small man in bib overalls and a battered
"Derby hat fussed around the stove . "" Ain't"

the little hombre in big overalls . Very soon he
had tin mugs filled with hot black coffee
sweetened with molasses for all and for us
there were two plates of beans

"handing them to us , "" but it 's all we 've got"
"as of now , apart from a few sacks of gold"

watched us as we ate the beans . Then when

""" It just about leaves everything wide open"
"for Mr. Pell and his bunch , "" observed"
The rest of the men there said nothing but
you could see they were hard it . They were
simple men who knew a lot maybe about
clinging for gold but were babes in arms
when it came to dealing with outlaws and
desperadoes like Pell and Fenton and the
"rest . ""I guess we 'd better hold onto the gold"

Gavin she had left her sun-

went quickly back to fetch them.

of despair Gay knew that of course
