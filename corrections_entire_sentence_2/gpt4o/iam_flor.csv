for those negligible events that seemed so large to
"the creatures participating in them. For Lily-yo, Flor"
and Haris there were many events. Chief of these was
that they learned to fly properly. The pains associated
with their wings soon died away as the wonderful
new flesh and tendon strengthened. To sail up in the
light gravity became an increasing delight - the ugly

For the time being Benyl was content to let

opportunity presented itself . He must
learn that he could not treat her
"with injustice and contempt , ignorantly"

"a schoolmaster and she a small ,"
It gave her no chance of any private

on his taking her out in the jeep-

Buh is the life of a naval officer's wife.
John's father had been a naval officer of the old
school ; some of his rigid ideas had been passed
on to the second generation . One of these was that
"an officer should sign a ship , on taking up a"
"new appointment , at nine am. precisely , dressed"
in the modern equivalent of frock-coat and sword .
It would have been acceptable to all concerned
if John had stepped into fort Blokhouse clad in

Searneed's memory was prodigious ; her manner
must have been worth a great deal to the proprietors
"of the hatd . She greeted Jahn , however , with less"

glance at him . Evidently the other occupant
of the bar was not persona grata . If her
"money was good , so was this stranger's"

After all its them wele suppored to be
"weling for , as well as the tomsfolk and"
with sonetlny of a Act I remembered the
man who'd brought us into this business.
""" Maybe you don't know about Appleton,"
"ben? "" "" I know what? "" "" That hey collapsed,"
I said. I watched him became I was always
fascinated by the way he looked when you
"tried to surprise him. "" Dead? "" he said. "" Yes."
Dead. Shuffled out of the check. Placed
down with a shotgun outside the Palace

"mining lamp , "" he said abruptly . He wheeled"
his horse back off the trail and up the slope
"leading to the ridge . I followed, From the"
top you could see something of the wild hill
country that lay all around Gilbury Crossing .
The air was fresh and clear and you
could be far west and north for many
miles . The real high country of the Rockies
lifted up in the distance We a pale water-
colour draining . Between us and that lay
"a vast world of hills , canyons , buttes and"
"The mine-woligg he north of the town , """
"said Dan . "" I f we head west we ought to"

"So me swury West , making slow going over"
"rough county , sliding on shale , climbing down"
"into draws , circling a big mba by a"
"four or five mile valley , sandy-colored . It"
got hotter as the day wore on and he rested
gratefully by a small creek where he watered
the horses and drank enough to cure ow
An hour's ride brought us to a trail that
we figured would lead to the miners camp .
We turned south into it and after about four
miles it led into a small canyon which
opened out into a wide shallow area .
Here in a dried-up creek-bed we found
the miners at work . They were scattered
over a fairly wide area working singly or
We didn't approach unchallenged. Iut onot
of the liggings there was a roughly-built
shack and on We gut new suveone invicle banled
"ont, ""If you come any closer, I ' ' sure blow"
"your whishers off."" ""Take it lory, mister, ' Isany"

go and tell Nick Dowd we've come to talk
to him about what happened lort nigh.'

"Whrotle then , loud and Owill . The jun borel"
peeking out through a hole in the Chack never
"wavered . We jut our horses , waiting . "" Louls us"
"though they 're expecting trouble , "" I said . ' Where"
"there ! gold and women there 's always trouble , '"
"observed Dan , shifting about in his saddle . He"
I saw several men running down towards
the shack. They were all armed with rifles
As the nearest of them came round the
"shack, his rifle at the ready, I saw it was Nick"
"Doud, still wearing his blue check shirt. He"
"came up close, eyeing us suspiciously. ""We've"
"come 2a-calling,"" I said. ""Can't see no reason"
"for calling,"" he said. ""Still long as you're here"
you may as well stay a while.
"Light an' come on in. "" We dismounted and"
one of the miners who'd come along with
Nick Doud took our horses off the water
We followed Nick down into the shack.
They'd rigged up a store of sorts and on it
a huge blackened coffee-pot steamed. Other
miners followed in at our heels. Nick Doud
found us a couple of boxes to sit on.
A small man in bib overalls and a battered
"Derby hat fussed around the stove . "" 2 Ain't"
exactly the Rite Hotel but we 've got our little
"comforts , ' said Boud . He introduced the men"
"who'd come in as Roper Smith , Shorty , Mick"
"Golightly , Swede and Sodbuster . This last was"
the little hombre in big overalls . Very soon he
had tin mugs filled with hot black coffee
sweetened with molasses for all and for us
there were two plates of beans
""" They give you the wind , "" said the Sodbuster"
"handing them to us , "" but it 's all we got"
"as of now , apart from a few sacks of gold"
"dust . "" He winked at his partners . They all"
watched us as we ate the beans . Then when
we 'd finished and I 'd rolled a cigarette
"the man called Shorty said , "" You were saying when"
you came in that something happened last
""" Yes , "" I said . "" Something happened all right ."
"After you 'd left the meeting , mister "" - I"
"looked across at Nick Sowd- "" someone cut"
down William Tippleton outside the Palace
"with a shotgun . "" I paused and watched my"
words affect them in their different ways .
""" That 's sure bad news , "" said Doud , sombrely ."
""" It just about leaves everything wide open"
"for Mr. Pell and his bunch , "" observed"
The rest of the men there said nothing but
you could see they were hard it . They were
simple men who knew a lot maybe about
digging for gold but were babes in arms
when it came to dealing with outlaws and
desperadoes like Pell and Fenton and the
"rest . '"" I guess we 'd better hold onto the gold"
"right 2hyar , Nick , "" said the Sodbuster ."
""" Yeah , "" said Dowd dubiously . "" Maybe we 'd"
"better . "" Surprisingly Dan Mattney came in at"
"that point . "" If you do , ' he said , "" you 'll be"
sure asking for trouble . They 'll be on your
necks before you can say ' knife . . It wouldn't
be the first time they 've held up a diggings
at gun point either . They 've done it before

""" You're Edurned tootin , mister , "" said the man"
called Roper Smith . ' We're got five rifles among

"on getting your gold to the bank , then we 'll"
"abide by what we said at the meeting , """
"said Dan . "" We 'll watch the stage out of reach . """
I couldn't quite see how all this fitted in
with Dan Maffrey's aim to arrange himself
on the Fenton bunch but still it was a
"handsome offer so I chimed in too . "" That"
"goes for me , gentlemen , "" I said . "" If they do try"
"and hold up the stage , it 'll be a couple or"
"three of them , no more . I reckon we can deal"
Mr. Copthome has a way round by the side
