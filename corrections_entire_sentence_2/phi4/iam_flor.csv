"and came into the living-room, where"
Heater and Eve stood again at
"his entrance. He came, momentarily falling"
"forward in an ungainly stumble, neck"
limp and arms dangling loosely.
"Then, abruptly, he drew himself up"
and walked on the very lips of
his toes. He shuffled his feet
"over his head and yawned again,"

"'The y have come!' he said reverently, gripping his"
hands together between his knees and leaning
forward. 'Isn't it a glorious thing! I long awaited
"this transcendent event, the exalted desire of all"
mankind through all ages! The Kingdom of the
Mind is at hand!' He turned beaming eyes
upward and shook his head slowly from
a superfluous precaution for there was no other car
about; and no pedestrian to cross his path nor to wait
at an intersection for the light to change. At his
apartment he garaged his car and then stood
listening in the night. Listening in vain. For the
"earth had lost its life- tempo, as the heart"
"Deadly stillness, deadly portent!"
Steve awakened early and switched on
"the radio, which he kept tuned to CB."
The set lighted up but gave only a low
buzzing sound. He had just finished
"shaving when it came on, with a flat"
"voice repeating: ""This is 3C calling"
"C calling..."""
"heard what seemed an unchaste period of repetition, the voice"
went on to describe the launching of the Thetan colony
"in Sussex, in all its obscene details. Then the radio"
"went clear again, and there was no stomach for"
"treaftust. It was a beautiful day, as firsts-of-the-year"
should be. Here got out the car and traversed the
"same empty streets as he had the night before,"
to keep an appointment with Heuther.
Coming around the great mass of the Château
"timer, he backed to a screeching stop. A"
flying saucer was tilting and dipping over
the war Memorial. There was a deep
"whining sound, and a high-pitched hissing"
overtone that sang in his ears with an
almost painfully sharpness. He reversed and
"turned back on Mr. Kengie Avenue,"
"""The Thetans,"" he said, ""are presumably here to"""
"take charge, as it were, of the minds of the"
people—who are probably falling all over them—in
their zeal to get their orders and to carry
"them out. Just what these orders will be, we don't"
"know. Now, because of prior hypnotic states, we have"
escaped thetan subjugation this time. But we no
longer have any immunity.
Then there can be little doubt that if the
Theorinr discover our mental independence
they will probably give us their hypnotic
treatment. If we avoid undue
"prominence, it may be that we can"
move about pretty easily without
"detection. It be can - well, then we"
may be able to promote our
interests. What those interests
"are, beyond personal secrets,"
"I haven't a clue; but, who knows,"
we may form the nucleus around . . .
"""Now to summarize what I think over"
"course of action should be. First, to avoid the"
"Thetans like the plague, for they must not"
"find us out; second, to tread pretty warily"
"among our own people, finding out just how"
much freedom we can take with safety.
"And third, to study these damned Thetans."
We must learn all we can about
There is just a hope that we may uncover
"some weakness, and find a way of fighting"
"back at them."" Heather agreed, and suggested"
that they use Dan as a specimen demon-
strating how the thetan machinations had been
working out. It seemed to Steve that this may
not have been entirely an objective suggestion
on her part; but he thought it a good idea
So they proceeded to see if the coast
was clear. The street was quiet and
"deserted, and there were neither sight"
"nor sound of flying saucers, so they"
ventured forth and made their way on
foot to Dan's house. Dan came
to the door at their ring but neglected
to offer any greeting. He was deeply
"preoccupied, and it seemed that the"
ringing of a doorbell was to him
a new and strange phenomenon -
"When he finally beckoned to them to enter, the action"
gave the impression of having been thought out and
"decided upon. Inside they sat down unbidden, while"
Dan paced the floor. He seemed completely unaware
"of their presence. They just stared at him, turning"
their heads like terni spectators as he walked up and
His whole attitude was a mixture of
impatience pending an awaited
communication and of a vague
perplexity respecting his surroundings
and the purpose he was to serve .

Heather and Steve tried to make themselves

"They followed him to a city bus stop on Carling Avenue, where"
"he waited. The curb, stop was a deserted island on an empty street."
"But not for long, for pedestrians and cars flocked upon"
the Avenue from its many tributary streets. It might have
"been a normal business-day bustle, except for two anomalies."
"First, it was Sunday morning, and, second, everyone"
"watched, or drove, or waited as if possessed of"
a single all-exclusive purpose.
"After a long wait, a bus appeared and they"
"followed the beaming Nen aboard, taking"
seats some rows behind him. See was

Then he would go back to Pato for a final spell of
real days and would return to New York in late
January or early February. Angelina might be a

"Heaven alone knew when, if ever, he would be"
"back on Moon again, and able to do"

"the future of everyone, including America, depends."
The recovery of his balance was due to the
"fact that he was living, individually without"
"expenses, with the people to whom none had"
sent him: little people who regarded him as
lucky to have descended from such economic altitudes.

I had a distinct impression that the

prepared for visitors. Mrs Caine said
We were to go no further unless
"until we were sent for, confirming"
another impression that became more
"and more definite, namely, that"
she was in touch with an invi-

"telly and of course Mrs Septimus, for surely"
Mr Septimus stood in the same case as
myself? But was it so? I allowed myself
"to entertain for an instant the idea, the"
"strange, the unwelcome, the most"
"inconvenient idea, that Ariadne's arrival"
would be inopportune; and with the idea came
"a somewhat vulgar impulse, which I refused,"
"to watch Mr Septimus more closely, Mrs"
Caine too and Mr Gilberts who would . . .
But all three were to the casual
observation I permitted myself unruffled;
Mr. Septionus reserved and certainly very
"thoughtful, but that was his habit. Indeed"
we were all invaded by a most tranquil
"mood. Even the Indian servants released, knowing,"
"so Mr. Galberto told us, that the wild and"
savage tribes never approached this region: at
"any rate they remained with us, perhaps"
"for such protection as our presence, or Mrs."
But after what Mrs Canhe had cried it was never

Mostorir was a booklover all his life; he had
been inclined to regard women as something
which must necessarily be subordinated to his
career. Now he realized that he was entrusting not only
"his own wife, but Geoffrey's as well, to a strange girl"
whom he had never met and on whom after no more
than a couple of telephone calls he was
prepared to place complete reliance
It was a horrible experience. Hlastar was
quite unable to explain why he should feel
so much confidence in her. Such against

obvious that she did not fully appreciate the

For some reason the orderlies had forgotten
to switch on the lights; there was no colour-
phantasmagorical features were distinguishable solely by
gradations of silvery greyness. Even the snow-
"capped summit of Mount Rainier, even miles"
"below, was not recognizable among the list"
of lower peaks. The screen of the air-to-air
radar glowed. Occasionally minute spots
"flickered across its surface, but there was"
In the exceptional charity he was even able to
make a direct comparison between the radar

"particular area within its range , Geoffrey"
turned the scale stowly 2 to cover the
ground immediately ahead .
"He was able to pick out towns, unrecognizable to the"
"naked eye, obscured by the ground haze which even"
on the clearest night limited angular vision. He glanced
at the speed recorder. It seemed almost incredible that
the tiny white figure of 8.5 against which the needle
was resting could really mean hundreds of knots.
"Now, as Hastair reduced the flammant, the"
pitch changed as the nose of the aircraft
lifted slightly. The needle of the speed

"ahead of time,"" said Hastair, ""He'll make"

smiled. Hastair talked of landing soon when
they were still more than four hundred
miles from their destination.
They were nearing Modena. Geoffrey focused the radar scanner
"on the bridge over the Po, barely forty miles to port:"
he was able to trace the course of the river;
"though he could recognise the look of Ding,"
along which he had motored so desperately
more than twenty-four hours earlier. Since then
"he had flown to England, attended the vital,"
"conference in Bruce Denton's office, been whisked"
by special helicopter from the Horse Guards

refreshing hours and had now completed two-thirds
of the journey back to the place where every
"indication pointed to ""Eve being held."""
Geoffrey set himself to consider the
movements of the Prentley. It had passed
him at the temporary budge over the
Taro at a few minutes past ten on the
previous night. He worked out the system
on the presumption that its route had been
through Florence and Rome and then
across Italy via Foggia to Bari.
It came to pass over at Luned
Darkness had descended like a curtain by the
"time they docked at Bellesay . And though any,"
"made nervous by Bery's silence , drove at reckless"
"speed to the villa , it was quickly evident that"
the party was over . Piers came strolling out to
"meet the Deanes , and as soon as any had"
"driven away , invited them casually to come to"
"TO Beryl, at least, this was anticlimax with a"
vengeance. She had expected to be met with vivid
reprimands - and here he was bland and smiling.
But it did not take her long to realize that his mood
was less pleasant than appeared on the surface.
"He told her nonchalantly, as he led the way to his"
"own veranda, that he had taken the liberty of"
asking Jack - as a representative of the Vallin family -
to come over and make the presentation in her stead.
"""I caught him just as he was going to the"
"airport to meet Blanche,"" he said. ""As a matter"
"of fact, I'd asked him last night to depart for me"
and fetch her. He brought her to the party too.
"They're both here."" ""I didn't know she was"
"coming back from Barbados so soon,"" Beryl said the first"
thing that came into her head.
"""ch, she was due!"" And then he added in the same"
"casual tone, ""She's not returning to her family. She's"
"going to live with friends of the bank manager, just"
"this side of Belleray."" Mrs. Deane made a suitable"
"comment, but Beryl said nothing. She was trying"
to sort things out in her mind. That beneath his
unnaturally smooth exterior he was simmering
with anger against her she had no doubt.

"But he remained above, and when best"
"suggested having a second party, the following wed, he"
"poured old winter on the prigs.' Everyone, he declared,"
had had a strongly good time and we would tell them
merely to be glad to have done down again. Meanwhile
he would have belabored himself and his well-
earned gratitude with his native rigour at the
It was all over and done with.
"For the time being, Benyl was content to let"
"it go at that, but she resolved to have"
it out with Piers when a reasonable
opportunity presented itself. He must
learn that he could not treat her
"with injustice and contempt, ignoring"
his explanations as though he were
"a schoolmaster and she a small,"
It was his no chance of any private
"conversation that evening, for when"
"Blanche and Jack left, he went with"
them. But next morning she insisted
on his taking her out in the jeep-
"to find, if possible, Albert and his"
"relations, and that they tell them of"
his great disappointment at being
helped up in Baliyon.
"With an air of resignation he sent Judy, his"
"booker, to the back, and made room for her"
"beside him. ""Is that all you want to do?"""

Their air of smiling confidence showed them
to have been guests at yesterday's
"celebrations, and their friendly welcome"
"and warm sympathy, as she explained"
"how she had come to miss the party,"
made her send a complacent glance
in Piers' direction. What a fuss-box the
"man was, she thought impatiently,"
trying to worry her into the belief
that her failure to appear at a function
on the estate was a major error :
"and then she received a jolt. Old Hubert, standing"
"beside her, his battered hat in his hand, his"
"tool-less maul stretched in a wide grin, told her"
"in halting patois that ""Mistah Pierce"" had"
"explained right at the start that ""Mis' Beryl"""
"would be 'plenty, plenty sad' not to be here at"
That it wouldn't be her fault at all. That

being flung against the jagged boulders did the judge
empty his lungs of sullying air and refill them
with part of that howling north wind gale.
"When the wind was on a rampage, as it was"

He didn't drown either; his mother threw him into
the water to make him hardy when he was young.
"Maybe that's why Bill can swim so well, too."
"The yawl, riding the high waves with an air that"
"might have made an ordinary person envious, seemed"
prepared to make a soft though violent landing
when there came a sudden gust of wind.

as though his son would actually
shoot the craft in under the outer
end of the wharf. But by pressing
the tiller he had over and at the

"corner of the pier by inches, and"
"with the tiller still had over, brought"
the yacht up against the waves

But it's the life of a naval officer's wife.
John's father had been a naval efficer of the old
sool ; some of his rigid ideas had been passed
on to the second generation . One of these was that
"an efficer should soin a ship , on taking up a"
"new appointment , at nine am. precisely , dressed"
in the modern equirlent of tro d-coat and sword .
Bt would have been acceptable to all concemed
if John had stepped into fort Blokhouse clad in
"plain-clothes on the previous night , but ways"
instilled by martinet pavents have a habiet of
"So he put up for the night at The Admiral's Head, that"
"famous Portsmouth hostelry, second only in historic"
"interest to The George, unhappily destroyed by German"
bombs during the last war. Having deposited his
baggage and unpacked his overnight-bag he
went in search of a drink. The lower bar was
"empty, save for the lady known by all habitués"
who was sipping moodily into a gin
Seaneed's memory was prodigious; her manner
must have been worth a great deal to the proprietors
"of the hotel. She greeted John, however, with less"
than her usual cordiality and flashed a warning
glance at him. Evidently the other occupant
of the bar was not persona grata. If her
"money was good, so was this stranger's"
"""You're Commander Winter,"" he said. 'T have a"
"gin?"" He turned to Seaneed -"
"""Make it a large one, darling. I knew the naval"
"halts."" Print up and call each other wallahs,"
"what!"" as the officer said on his return"
"from a visit to the Royal Navy. Submarines, what."
"Youngest D.S.C. in the war, what? Craned"
inside a submarine casing to defuse a Jerry
bomb. Should have been a U-boat.
"What are you waiting for, darling? The officer is"
"obviously thirsty. "" John fought back his"
inherited desire to snub the man. If he did he
would have to leave the bar and either sit in
the lounge or return to his head room.
Seaweed sensed his embarrassment and
"came to the rescue. "" You haven't introduced"
"yourself,"" she said with mild severity."
"""It's a usual these premises. No treating with"
"strangers -that's right, Jam? Isn't it?"" ""My"
"fault entirely,"" said the stranger. ""It's my conceited"
nature- assumed that you both knew who I
was. Jon Jan Pawley. Does that mean anything
"to you?"" It did. Jan Pawley's name was"
printed at the head of most naval articles.
"""Ok, the Press,"" said Senveed. ""Now here on business, Mr."
"Bawley?"" ""A prestman is always on the job."""
He held out his hand and John could not do
"otherwise than take it. ""Pleased to meet you,"""
"he said. ""Now what about that"
"drink?"" John nodded - he could afford to buy"
one in return and he was lonely.
"""For the sake of accuracy,"" he said, ""'and I know"""
how you newspaper value that commodity! -
please don't address me as Commander. I'm
a Lieutenant-Commander. Perhaps we could
"drop the rank - such a mouthful!"" ""You're"
"absolutely right,"" said Bawley, as he pushed over"
"his glass. ""Fill it up, darling. Accuracy above"
"all base. We pride ourselves on accuracy."""
Ever known as bold a bout your Service?
Check and double-check - nothing but the truth.
"Somewhat embarrassing, what? "" How can the"
"truth be embarrassing."" John sipped his double"

he was on the verge of a new chapter in
"his career, and his companion's attitude was"

trifle too comfortable and humdrum.

"Bawley. ""The truth is usually very embar-"

"Other half?"" John nodded. 'On me.' Bawley"
"shook his head. 'It's paid for by His Lordship,'"
he said. 'Expense account. You're a married
man with a couple of kids. Can't you wasting
your substance on a complete stranger. But
"John flushed . "" I 'm not in need of charty ."" "" Come"
"off it "" sait Bawley . "" The propnictor of the Paily"
"Canier knows what 's going on . If he doessit mind ,"
"Why should you ? "" "" I sue . "" Johu took the"

"""The message, my dear,"" said Bannister. ""Then have"
nothing to tell me yet. But we'll be meeting
"again in no doubt, and then you will have"
regard this as a softening-up process and
"have dinner with me. On the Lordship,"
"of course."" ""On one condition,"" said Jordan."
"Reveal to me who the little bird was."" ""Can't"
you guess: whose portrait appears regularly
"You mean Nunyard? ""Sure."" Very useful."
"Centact, is our Robbovin; he gives us the gen and"
we give him the publicity. The Honorable

"sort of thing: ""You'll get nothing out of me,"""
said John. 'But you can pay for my drinks
"if you want to, as long as you keep off"
"""Good day! One for the guilt from darting,"" and"
"tell George to bring in the brat du jour."""
Bucky was a man of his word. He kept
"away from Service matters, was an excellent"
host and a splendid raconteur. The evening
passed all too quickly. As they parted in
"the vestibule, the two men were well"
disposed towards one another.
""" Ever been to Flut Street? asked Banly."""
' You should deft time you're in Town'
give me a ring at this number and I'll
take you round to the pubs where most

"""I shall be busy for a while, cleaning up after"
"Master bloody Munyard."" There were six submarines,"
lying in pairs alongside the jetty at Ford Blockhouse.
Place and grimly business-like they both loaded and
"sounded, for all of them were trembling as they"
charged their electric batteries.
A light wind carried the smoke of diesel exhaust in
through the open windows of the Captain's house. It
pervaded every room but neither Harry nor Madeleine
Turton noticed its existence as they sat in silence over
a substantial breakfast. Although usually a very
"talkative lady, Madeleine respected her husband's"
"silences, for she knew they betokened a worry of"
There had been many such breakfasts lately since the
affair of Parsilal. Harry had lost a good deal of weight.

but she could see that it no longer came naturally.
It is the common lot of all Squadron Senior Officers
"to experience such catastrophes as the loss of a submarine,"
though in peacetime these happenings are few and
This is the testing time for all. The affair blows up into
a national disaster and then when it is all over life
must continue as before. During this period the Captain
must present an unmuffled appearance and carry on as
if nothing unusual has happened. Harry Turton had
"written letters to the bereaved, had visited many in the"
"locality, had been interviewed by the Press, had driven"
his surviving submarines a good deal harder than
usual and in fact had applied all the usual specifics

An hour's ride brought us to a trail that
we allured would lead to the miners' camp.
We turned north into it and after about for
miles it led into a small canyon which
opened out into a wide shallow area.
Here in a dried-up creek-bed we found
the miners' cot-work. They were called
over a fairly nice well working singly or
We didn't approach unchallenged. It was not

shack and on we got new someone involved called

I saw several men running down towards
the shack. They were all armed with rifles
As the nearest of them came round the
"shat, his rifle at the ready, I saw it was Nick"
"Doud, still wearing his blue check shirt. He"
"came up close, eyeing us suspiciously. ""We've"
"come a-calling,"" I said. ""Can't see no reason"
"for calling,"" he said. ""'Still as long as you're here"
you may as well stay a while.
"Light an' come on in."" We dismounted and"
one of the miners who'd come along with
Nick Noud took our horses off the water.
We followed Nick into the shack.
They'd rigged up a store of sorts and on it
a huge blackened coffee-pot steamed. Other
miners followed in at our heels. Nick Noud
found us a couple of boxes to sit on.
A small man in bib overalls and a battered
"Derby hat fussed around the stove . "" 2 Ain't"

"who'd come in as Roper Smith , Shorty , Mick"
"Golightly , swede and Sodbuster . This last was"
the little hombre in big overalls . Very soon he
had tin mugs filled with hot black coffee
surectened with molasses for all and for us
there were two plates of beans
"""They give you the wind,"" said the Sodbuster."
"handing them to us, ""but it's all we got"
"as of now, apart from a few sacks of gold"
"dust."" He winked at his partners. They all"
watched us as we ate the beans. Then when
"we'd finished and I'd rolled a cigarette,"
"the man called Shorty said, ""You were saying when"
you came in that Esomep n happened last.

The rest of the men there said nothing but
you could see they were hard at it. They were
simple men who knew a lot maybe about
digging for gold but were babes in arms
when it came to dealing with outlaws and
desperadoes like Pell and Fenton and the
"rest . '"" I guess we 'd better hold onto the gold"
"right 2hyar, Nick,"" said the Sodbuster."
"""Yeah,"" said Dowd dubiously. ""Maybe we'd"
"better."" Surprisingly, Dan Mattney came in at"
"that point. ""If you do,"" he said, ""you'll be"
sure asking for trouble. They'll be on your

be the first time they've held up a diggings

I couldn't quite see how all this fitted in
with Dan Maffrey's aim to arrange himself
on the Fenton bunch but still it was a
"handsome offer so I chimed in too . "" That"

"Canery and corruption, the growth of the clearly"

was Mr. Copthorne all right. Perhaps he had
been attending some kind of fancy dress do

Gay went out to the waiting
"taxi, and then found that in"
the excitement of meeting
Gavin she had left her sun-
glasses on the veranda. She
went quickly back to fetch them.
Gavin and the Girl who had got
off the plane with him were talking.
He was writing something in his
"pocket-book, with such a feeling"
of despair Gay knew that of course
"Gay, sitting opposite Gavin on the terrace, could"
"hardly believe that she was the same girl,"
"miserable, sly, who had sat at the little"
table for the first time a few days ago.
"Gavin raised his glass to her and smiled,"
and Gay's face turned over. 'I'd like
to do that.' Gavin drained his glass
"""And then we'll go for a stroll along the"
"beach. A moon like this mustn't be wasted."""
He gestured towards the bay where the full
"moon was just rising over the rocks, then"
laid his hand on Lori's shoulder and smiled at her
"again, happy and believing, knowing that"
now no one was in love with her but her
"only, yet remembering for a second the"
kisses she had seen him giving Claire.
"All that was part of the past, she would put it behind her. She"
"would never be jealous again, would even take Larry's advice and"
"look the other way if need be. ""I say,"" Gwyn was looking over her"
"shoulder. ""That's a pretty girl!"" Gay glanced behind her, ""Does she"
"look lovely? She's French, a very well-known mademoiselle I believe."
"Gay, a little puzzled, went through"
to the bar. Doc and Lilyan were
sitting just inside having coffee.
"""Come and join us, bringing your"
"boyfriend,"" Noc called. ""No, no,"" I"
Lilyan remonstrated. 'They want to be

Gail thought him and walked out to
the terrace thinking that perhaps Gavin
had bought a drink and taken it outside.
"All looked round scanning the tables,"
"then caught her breath, a cold hand"
seeming to clutch last. Gavin was
seated at a small table in a shadowy
corner talking animatedly to Simone.

as Fay chewed out a chair and sat -

trying to understand Fay's point of
view and remembering the advice
"that Dane had given her, while she"
felt wrecked beyond words.
His behaviour was not only boorish and the worst of
taste but it was unkind beyond words. She fumbled
with the cigarette packet which lay on the table
not wanting to imitate but needing some action
to help her control her feelings. 'Come and

"life line and Gay got up quickly, man-"
"As he swung her onto the floor, Gay saw Gavin"
and Simone go through the doorway that Ted
"had down to the beach. Gay closed ""her eyes for a"
moment in disgust. She was fully aware that having

after Simone had left expect her to accept his
"advances on the way back to the hotel,"
