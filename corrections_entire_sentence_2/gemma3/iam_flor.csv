"the creatures participating in them. For Lily-yo, Flor"

that they learned to fly properly. The pains associated
with their wings soon died away as the wonderful
new flesh and tendon strengthened. To sail up in the
light gravity became an increasing delight - the ughy

"own veranda , that he had taken the liberty of"
asking Jack - as a representative of the Vallin family -
to come over and make the presentation in her stead .

said the first thing that came into her head .

"casual tone, ""She's not returning to her family. She's"
"going to live with friends of the bank manager, just"
"this side of Belleray."" Mrs. Deaue made a suitable"
"comment, but Beryl said nothing. She was trying"
to sort things out in her mind. That beneath his

For the time being Beryl was content to let

He gave her no chance of any private

An hour's riding brought us to a trail that

the miners cot work . They were scattered

one of the miners who'd come along with
Nick Noud took our horses off the water

a huge blackened coffee- pot steamed . Other

there were two plates of beans

The rest of the men there said nothing but
you could see they were hard at it . They were

digging for gold but were babes in arms
when it came to dealing with outlaws and
desperadoes like Pell and Fenton and the
