Geoffrey set himself to consider the
movements of the Bentley . It had passed
him at the temporary bridge over the
Tartaro at a few minutes past ten on the
previous night . He worked out the distance
on the assumption that its route had been
through Florence and Rome and then
across Italy via Forgia to Barletta .
It came to pass over at lunered
Darkness had descended like a curtain by the

the party was over . Piers came strolling out to
"meet the Deanes , and as soon as any had"
"driven away , invited them casually to come to"
"TO Beryl , at least , this was anti-climax with a"
vengeance . She had expected to be met with violent
reproaches - and here he was bland and smiling .
But it did not take her long to realise that his mood
was less pleasant than appeared on the surface .
"He told her nonchalantly , as he led the way to his"
"own veranda , that he had taken the liberty of"
asking Jack - as a representative of the Vallin family -
to come over and make the presentation in her stead .

"going to lire with friends of the bank manager , just"

For the time being Benyl was content to let

It gave her no chance of any private
"conversation that evening , for when"

on his taking her out in the jeep-
"to find , if possible , Albert and his"
