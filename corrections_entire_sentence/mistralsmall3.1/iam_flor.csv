upward and shook his head slowly from
a superfluous precaution for there was no other car
abroad; and no pedestrian to cross his path nor to wait
at an intersection for the light to change. At his

listening in the night. Listening in vain. For the

to keep an appointment with Heather .

flying saucer was tilting and dipping over

was clear. The street was quiet and
deserted and there were neither sight
nor sound of flying sancerse so they
ventured forth and made their way on

to the door at their ring but neglected
to offer any greeting. He was deeply
"preoccupied, and it seemed that the"
ringing of a doorbell was to him
a new and strange phenomenon -
"When he finally beckoned to them to enter, the action"
gave the impression of having been thought out and
"decided upon. Inside they sat down beside, while"
Dan paced the floor. He seemed completely unaware
"of their presence. They just stared at him, turning"

His whole attitude was a mixture of
impatience pending an awaited

"been a normal business-day bustle, except for two anomalies."
"First, it was Sunday morning, and, second, everyone"

But is the life of a naval officer's wife.
John's father had been a naval officer of the old
school; some of his rigid ideas had been passed
on to the second generation. One of these was that
"an officer should join a ship, on taking up a"
"new appointment, at nine am. precisely, dressed"
in the modern equivalent of frock-coat and sword.
But would have been acceptable to all concerned
if John had stepped into Fort Blockhouse clad in
"plain-clothes on the previous night, but ways"
instilled by martinet parents have a habit of

went in search of a drink. The lower bar was

Seaneed's memory was prodigious; her manner
must have been worth a great deal to the proprietors
"of the hard. She greeted Jahn, however, with less"
than her usual cordiality and flashed a warning
glance at him. Evidently the other occupant
of the bar was not persona grata. If her
"money was good, so was this stranger's"
"""You're Commander Winter,"" he said. 'Have a"
"gin?"" He turned to Seaneed -"

"What are you waiting for, darling? The officer is"
"obviously thirsty. "" John fought back his"
inherited desire to snub the man. If he did he
would have to leave the bar and either sit in

Seaweed sensed his embarrassment and
"came to the rescue. "" You haven't introduced"
"yourself,"" she said with mock severity."

I saw several men running down towards

one of the miners who'd come along with
Nick Noud took our horses off the water

They'd rigged up a store of sorts and on it
a huge blackened coffee- pot steamed . Other

there were two plates of beans

""" It just about leaves everything wide open"
"for Mr. Pell and his bunch , "" observed"
The rest of the men there said nothing but
you could see they were hard it. They were
simple men who knew a lot maybe about
cligging for gold but were babes in arms
when it came to dealing with outlaws and
desperadoes like Pell and Fenton and the
