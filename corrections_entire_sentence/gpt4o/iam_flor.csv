Buh is the life of a naval officer's wife .
John's father had been a naval officer of the old
school; some of his rigid ideas had been passed
on to the second generation. One of these was that
"an officer should join a ship, on taking up a"
"new appointment, at nine a.m. precisely, dressed"
in the modern equivalent of frock-coat and sword.
It would have been acceptable to all concerned

must have been worth a great deal to the proprietors
"of the hatd . She greeted Jahn , however , with less"

glance at him . Evidently the other occupant
of the bar was not persona grata . If her
"money was good , so was this stranger's"

the miners at work . They were called

one of the miners who'd come along with
Nick Noud took our horses off the water
We followed Nick down into the shack .
They'd rigged up a store of sorts and on it
a huge blackened coffee- pot steamed . Other
