So it lets us rule it . ' Flor and Lily-yo

Flor - this other man creature is plainly useless -

"asked . ' What else ! Flor and Lily-yo , you arrive"
here at good time . Memories of the Heavy World

gosped Flor . ' Yes . We plan to attack the Heavy

"afternoon of eternity wore on , that long golden road"
of an afternoon that would somewhere lead to
"Hation there was, but notion without event - except"
for those negligible event that seemed so large to
"the creatures participating in them. For Lily-yo, Flor"
and Haris there were many events. Chief of these was
that they learned to fly properly. The pains associated
with their wings soon died away as the wonderful
new flesh and tendon strengthened. To sail up in the
