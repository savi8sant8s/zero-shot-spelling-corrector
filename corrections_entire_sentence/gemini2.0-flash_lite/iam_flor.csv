After a long wait a bus appeared and they

A light wind cafted the smoke of diesel exhaust in

This is the testing time for all . The affair blows up into

one of the miners who'd come along with
Nick Noud took our horses off the water
We followed Nick wond into the shack .
They'd rigged up a store of sorts and on it
a huge blackened coffee- pot steamed . Other

found us a couple of boxes to sit on .

The rest of the men there said nothing but
you could see they were hard it . They were

cligging for gold but were babes in arms
when it came to dealing with oulhooters and
desperadoes like Pell and Fenton and the
