upward and shook his head slowly from
a superfluous precaution for there was no other car
abroad; and no pedestrian to cross his path nor to wait
at an intersection for the light to change. At his

listening in the night. Listening in vain. For the

Steve awakened early and switched on
"the radio, which he kept tuned to CB0."
The set lighted up but gave only a low
buzzing sound. He had just finished

flying saucer was tilting and dipping over
the war Memorial. There was a deep
"whining sound, and a high-pitched hissing"
overtone that sang in his ears with an
almost painfully sharpness. He reversed and
"turned back on Mr. Kengie Avenue,"
"""The Thetans,"" he said, ""are presumably here to"
"take charge, as it were, of the minds of the"
people—who are probably falling all over them—
themselves in their zeal to get their orders and to carry
"them out. Just what these orders will be, we don't"
"know. Now, because of prior hypnosis, we have escaped"

There is just a hope that we may uncover
"some weakness, and find a way of fighting"
"back at them. "" Heather agreed, and suggested"
that they use Dan as a specimen demon-
shaming how the thetan machinations had been
working out. It seemed to Steve that this may
not have been entirely an objective suggestion
on her part; but he thought it a good idea
So they proceeded to see if the coast
was clear . The street was quiet and
deserted and there were neither sight
nor sound of flying saucers so they
ventured forth and made their way on
foot to Dan's house . Dan came
to the door at their ring but neglected
to offer any greeting . He was deeply
"preoccupied , and it seemed that the"
ringing of a doorbell was to him
a new and strange phenomenon -
"When he finally beckoned to them to enter, the action"
gave the impression of having been thought out and
"decided upon. Inside they sat down *unbidden*, while"
Dan paced the floor. He seemed completely unaware
"of their presence. They just stared at him, turning"
their heads like *terni* spectators as he walked up and
His whole attitude was a mixture of
impatience pending an awaited
communication and of a vague
perplexity respecting his surroundings
and the purpose he was to serve.

Heather and Steve tried to make themselves

"he waited. The lower, stop was a deserted island on an empty street."
"But not for long, for pedestrians and cars flocked upon"
the Avenue from its many tributary streets. It might have
"been a normal business-day bustle, except for two anomalies."
"First, it was Sunday morning, and, second, everyone"

a single all-exclusive purpose.
"After a long wait, a bus appeared and they"

'You see. You needed then no more. You are **gifted**.'
Young. One may be too old to have babies. Some of those
babies may be born with wings. ' The Captive with

as we are. Some may be born night.'

"you not killed ! ' ' Because we know all things , ' the"
Chief Captive said . Suddenly his second head roused
"itself and declared , ' To be a good shape is not al"
one in life . To know is also good . Because we cannot move
well we can - think . This tribe of the True World
is good and knows these things .
So it lets us rule it . ' Flor and Lily-yo
uttered together . ' Do you say that you poor
Captives rule the True world ! ' Lily-yo asked
at last . ' We do . ' ' Then why are you captives ? '
"The flyman with ear lobes and thumbs connected ,"
"making his perpetual little gesture of protest ,"
"' To rule is to serve, woman. Those who bear power"

"We are captives, we have the time to talk and"

"come to you, Lily-yo,' Band Appa Bondi added."
' You will live among us and enjoy your life free
' No ! ' the Chief Captive said with both hands.
"Before she can enjoy, Lily-yo and her companion"
Flor - this other man-creature is plainly useless -
"must help our great plan.' ' The invasion ? "" Bondi"
"asked. ' What else! Flor and Lily-yo, you arrive"
here at good time. Memories of the Heavy World
and its savage life are still fresh in you.
We need such memories. So we ask you to go
back there on a great plan we have . ' ' Go back ? '
gossiped Flor . ' Yes . We plan to attack the Heavy
World . You must help to lead our force . ' The long
"afternoon of eternity wore on , that long golden road"
of an afternoon that would somewhere lead to
"Hation there was, but notion without event—except"
for those negligible events that seemed so large to
"the creatures participating in them. For Lily-yo, Flor"
and Haris there were many events. Chief of these was
that they learned to fly properly. The pains associated
with their wings soon died away as the wonderful
new flesh and tendon strengthened. To sail up in the
light gravity became an increasing delight—the ugly

Mostorir was a buchelon M his life he had
been viclined to regard Nomen as something
Which must necessarily be subordinated to his
career . Now he realised that he was entrusting not only
"his own wife , but Geoffrey's as well , to a strange girl"
whom he had never met and on whom after no more
than a couple of telephone calls he was
prepared to place complete reliance
It was a hovel experience. Hlastar was
quite unable to explain why he should feel
so much Confidence in her. Such again
she checked back her instructions. It was
obvious that she did not fully appreciate the
faith with which he was pleading in her and
was prepared to accept the responsibility.
"Good land, Sir Marner, she said gently. ' Sul"
I'll be waiting for you at the Hotel Roma at six this
evening - and I shall look forward to seeing you

uneventful life had he come across a girl who
sounded so charming and appeared to be so
For some reason the orderlies had forgotten
to switch on the lights; there was no colour-
phantasmagorical features were distinguishable solely by
gradations of silvery greyness. Even the snow-
"capped summit of Mount Rainier, even miles"
"below, was not recognizable among the list"
of lower peaks. The screen of the ar-to-air
radar glowed. Occasionally minute spots
"flickered across its surface, but there was"
In the exceptional charity he was even able to
make a direct comparison between the radar
image and the ground itself . Thea d'Vay the
"Plain of Lembardy ; to the right , Turin ; to the"
"left , Milan . The directional angle of the"
scanner could be adjusted to cover any
"particular area within its range, Geoffrey"
turned the scale slowly 2 to cover the
ground immediately ahead .
"He was able to pick out towns, unrecognizable to the"
"naked eye, obscured by the ground haze which even"
on the clearest night limited angular vision. He glanced
at the speed recorder. It seemed almost incredible that
the tiny white figure of 8.5 against which the needle
was resting could really mean hundreds of knots.
"Now, as Hastair reduced the **flame**, the"
pitch changed as the nose of the aircraft
dipped slightly. The needle of the speed

"before coming to rest at 50, ""We're a bit"
"ahead of time,"" said Hastain, ""He'll make"
"in on minimum engine power."" Geoffrey"
smiled. Hastair talked of landing when
they were still more than four hundred
miles from their destination.
They were nearing Modena. Geoffrey focused the radar scanner
"on the bridge over the Po, barely forty miles to port:"
he was able to trace the course of the river;
though he could recognise the look of Ding. The
road along which he had motored so desperately
"more than twenty-four hours earlier. Since then,"
"he had flown to England, attended the vital,"
"conference in Bruce Denton's office, been whisked"
by special helicopter from the Horse Guards

refreshing hours and had now completed two-thirds
of the journey back to the place where every
"indication pointed to ""Eve"" being held."
Geoffrey sed himself to consider the
movements of the Prentley. It had passed
him at the temporary budge over the
Tartero at a few minutes past ten on the
precious night. He worked out the Sistanne
on the presumption that its route had been
through Florence and Rome and then
across Italy via Foggia to Bari.
It came to pass over at Luned
DARKNESS had descended like a curtain by the
"time they docked at Bellesay . And though none,"
"made nervous by Bery's silence , drove at reckless"

the party was over . Piers came strolling out to
"meet the Deanes , and as soon as any had"
"driven away , invited them casually to come to"

vengeance. She had expected to be met with vivid
reprimands - and here he was bland and smiling.
But it did not take her long to realise that his mood
was less pleasant than appeared on the surface.
"He told her nonchalantly, as he led the way to his"
"own veranda, that he had taken the liberty of"
asking Jack - as a representative of the Vallin family -
to come over and make the presentation in her stead.
""" I caught him just as he was going to the"
"airport to meet Blanche, "" he said. "" As a matter"
of fact I'd asked him last night to departise
for me and fetch her. He brought her to the party
"too. They're both here. "" ""I didn't know she was"
"coming back from Barbados as soon. "" Beryl"
said the first thing that came into her head.
"""ch, she was due!"" And then he added in the same"
"casual tone, ""She's not returning to her family. She's"
"going to live with friends of the bank manager, just"
"this side of Belleray."" Mrs. Deane made a suitable"
"comment, but Beryl said nothing. She was trying"
to sort things out in her mind. That beneath his

with anger against her she had no doubt.

"For the time being, Benyl was content to let"
"it go at that, but she resolved to have"
it out with Piers when a reasonable
opportunity presented itself. He must
learn that he could not treat her
"with injustice and contempt, ignoring"
his explanations as though he were
"a schoolmaster and she a small,"
It was his no chance of any private
"conversation that evening, for when"
"Blanche and Jack left, he went with"
them. But next morning she insisted
on his taking her out in the jeep-
"to find, if possible, Albert and his"
"relations, and that they tell them of"
his great disappointment at being
helped up in Balison.
"With an air of resignation he sent Judy, his"

Their air of smiling **confidence** showed them
to have been guests at yesterday's
"celebrations, and their friendly welcome"
"and warm sympathy, as she explained"
"how she had come to miss the party,"
made her send a complacent glance
in Piers' direction. What a fuss-box the
"man was, she thought impatiently,"
trying to worry her into the belief
that her failure to appear at a function
on the estate was a major error:
"and then she received a jolt. Old Hubert, standing"
"beside her, his battered hat in his hand, his"

But it's the life of a naval officer's wife.
John's father had been a naval efficer of the old
sool ; some of his rigid ideas had been passed
on to the second generation . One of these was that
"an efficer should soin a ship , on taking up a"
"new appointment , at nine am. precisely , dressed"
in the modern equirlent of tro d-coat and sword .
Bt would have been acceptable to all concemed
if John had stepped into fort Blokhouse clad in
"plain-clothes on the previous night , but ways"
instilled by martinet pavents have a habiet of
"So he put up for the night at The Admiral's Head, that"
"famous Portsmouth hostelry, second only in historic"
"interest to The George, unhappily destroyed by German"
bombs during the last war. Having deposited his
baggage and unpacked his overnight-bag he
went in search of a drink. The lower bar was
"empty, save for the lady known by all habitués"
who was moodily stirring into a gin
Seaneed's memory was prodigious; her manner
must have been worth a great deal to the proprietors
"of the hotel. She greeted Jahn, however, with less"
than her usual cordiality and flashed a warning
glance at him. Evidently the other occupant
of the bar was not persona grata. If her
"money was good, so was this stranger's"
"""You're Commander Winter,"" he said. 'T have a"
"gin?"" He turned to Seaneed -"
""" Make it a large one, darling. I knew the naval"
"halts."" Prink epin and call each other wallahs,"
"what!"" as the Euardsofficer said on his return"
"from a visit to the Royal Navy. Submarines, what."
"Youngest D.S.C. in the war, what? Craned"
inside a submarine casing to defuse a Jerry
bomb. Should have been a U.C.
"What are you waiting for, darling? The officer is"
"obviously thirsty. "" John fought back his"
inherited desire to snub the man. If he did he
would have to leave the bar and either sit in
the lounge or return to his head room.
Seaweed sensed his embarrassment and
"came to the rescue. "" You haven't introduced"
"yourself,"" she said with mock severity."
"""It's usual these premises. No treating with"
"strangers—that's right, James, isn't it?"" ""My"
"fault entirely,"" said the stranger. ""It's my conceited"
nature—assumed that you both knew who I
was. John Jan Pawley. Does that mean anything
"to you?"" It did. Jan Pawley's name was"
printed at the head of most naval articles.
""" Ok , the Press '' said Senveed . ' Nown here on business , Mr."
"Bawley ? "" "" A prestman is always on the job . """
He held out his hand and John could not do
"otherevise than take it . "" Pleased to mect you ,"
"Commander , "" he said . "" "" Now what about that"
"drink ? "" John nodded - he could afford to buy"
one in return and he way lonely .
"""For the sake of accuracy,"" he said, ""and I know"
"how you newspaper value that commodity!"" -"
Please don't address me as Commander. I'm
a Lieutenant-Commander. Perhaps we could
"drop the rank - such a mouthful!"" ""You're"
"absolutely right,"" said Bawley, as he pushed over"
"his glass. ""Fill it up, darling. Accuracy above"
all base. We pride ourselves on accuracy.
Ever known as bold about your Service?
Checkmate and won't-check - nothing but the truth.
"Somewhat embarrassing, what? "" How can the"
"truth be embarrassing."" John sipped his double"
"gin with relish. It was his favourite brand,"
he was on the verge of a new chapter in
"his career, and his companion's attitude was"

trifle too comfortable and humdrum.
He'd never before met a pressman and
"found him curiously stimulating. ""You're a"
"bit of a humorist, aren't you?"" said"
"Bawley. ""The truth is usually very embarrassing."
"Journal in submarines, aren't you?"""
"""You know a great deal about me,"""
'Tis my business. Fill tell you more. You're
going to take over command of Perides. Am I
"right? ""Who told you?"" ""Little bird."""
"Other half? ""John nodded. 'On me.'"" Bawley"
"shook his head. ""'A deal paid for by His Lordship,"""
he said. 'Expense account. You're a married
man with a couple of kids. Can't you wasting
your substance on a complete stranger. But
"John flushed. ""I'm not in need of charity."" ""Come"
"off it,"" said Bawley. ""The proprietor of the Daily"
"Canier knows what's going on. If he doesn't mind,"
"why should you?"" ""I sue."" John took the"
refilled glass and looked over the rim at his
"companion. ""You want me to talk, is that it?"""
"""The misspidge me,"" said Banly. ""Then have"
nothing to tell me yet. But we'll be meeting
"going on, no doubt, and then you will have"

"have dinner with me. On the Lordship,"
"of course."" ""On one condition,"" said Joten."
"Spell me who the little bird was."" ""Can't"
you guess: whose portrait appears regularly
"You mean Nunyard? "" "" Sure. Very useful"
"Centact, is our Robbovin; he gives us the gen and"
we give him the publicity. The Honorable

said John. 'But you can pay for my drinks
"if you want to, as long as you keep off"
"""Good day! One for the gulf from darting, and"
tell George to bring in the brandy of the jour.'
Bavy was a man of his word. He kept
"away from Service matters, was an excellent"
host and a splendid raconteur. The evening
passed all too quickly. As they parted in
"the vestibule, the two men were well"
disposed towards one another.
""" Ever been to Flut Street? asked Banly."
' You should Delight in time you're in Town

take you round to the pubs where most
"of the work is done."" He held out a card."
John took it and put it in his pocket.

"lets me off the chain, I'll take you"
Ever been out in a submarine? Y'll give
"you a spin round one of these days, if you"
"like. You could write it up. ""Banley made a faux pas."
""" Not in Pericles, old man."" ""Why not?"""
"""Better ask Robbic Mumyard."" ""What's he been"

"Master bloody Munyard."" THERE were six submarines,"
lying in pairs alongside the jetty at Ford Blockhouse.
Black and grimly business-like they both loaded and
"sounded, for all of them were trembling as they"
charged their electric batteries.
A light wind **carried** the smoke of diesel exhaust in
through the open windows of the Captain's house. It
pervaded every room but neither Harry nor Madeleine
Turton noticed its existence as they sat in silence over

man who'd brought us into this business.
"""Maybe you don't know about Appleton,"
"Ben?"" I know what? ""That he died,"""
I said. I watched him become. I was always
fascinated by the way he looked when you
"tried to surprise me. ""Peed?"" 'he said. 'Yes."
Dead. Shuffled out of the check. Placed
down with a handgun outside the Palace.
"""Fenton as Somers,"" he said. ""Or the town"""
"Marshal,"" I added. His face was fixed,"
"unreadable as a rock."" Let's go over to the"
"mining lamp,"" he said abruptly. He wheeled"
his horse back off the trail and up the slope
"leading to the ridge. I followed, from the"
top you could see something of the wild hill
country that lay all around Gilbury Crossing.
"The air was fresh and clear, and you"
could see far west and north for many
miles. The real high country of the Rockies
"lifted up in the distance, a pale water-"
colour draining. Between us and that lay
"a ventre of hills, canyons, bulges and"
"The mine-working is not of the town, """
"said Dan. ""If we head west we ought to"
cut the trail leading from gravelly to the north.
"So me swore West, making slow going over"
"rough country, sliding on shale, climbing down"

gladly by a small creek where he watered
the horses and drank enough to cure or
An hour's ride brought us to a trail that
we allured would lead to the miners' camp.
We turned north into it and after about
miles it led into a small canyon which
opened out into a wide shallow area.
Here in a dried-up creek-bed we found
the miners' cot camp. They were called
"over a fairly mile-wide area, working singly or"
We didn't approach unchallenged. It was not
of the buildings there was a rough-and-built
shack and on we got someone involved called
"out, ""If you come any closer, I'll be sure to blow"
"your whiskers off."" ""Take it easy, mister,"" said some"
"one out. ""We don't aim to come any closer and we've never"
got no weapons so as you can see. But you
go and tell Nick Dowd we've come to talk
"to him about what happened last night."""

"Whistle then, long and shrill. The juniper"
peeking out through a hole in the shack never
"wavered. We just our horses, wait. "" Look us"
"though they're expectin' trouble,"" I said. ""Where"
"there! Gold and women there's always trouble,'"
"observed Dan, fidgety about in his saddle. He"
I saw several men running down towards
the shack. They were all armed with rifles
As the nearest of them came round this
"shat, his rifle at the ready, I saw it was Nick"
"Doud, still wearing his blue check shirt. He"
"came up close, eyeing us suspiciously. ""We've"
"come a-calling,"" I said. ""Can't see no reason"
"for calling,"" he said. ""'Still long as you're here"
you may as well stay a while.
"Light an' come on in . "" We dismounted and"
one of the miners who'd come along with
Nick Noud took our horses off the water
We followed Nick wond into the shack .
They'd rigged up a store of sorts and on it
a huge blackened coffee-pot steamed. Other
miners followed in at our heels. Nick Noud
found us a couple of boxes to sit on .
A small man in bib overalls and a battered
"Derby hat fussed around the stove. "" 'Tain't"
exactly the Right Hotel but we've got our little
"comforts,"" said Buddy. He introduced the men"
"who'd come in as Roper Smith, Shorty, Mick"
"Golightly, Swede and Sodbuster. This last was"
the little hombre in big overalls. Very soon he
had tin mugs filled with hot black coffee
sweetened with molasses for all and for us
there were two plates of beans.
"""They give you the wind,"" said the Sodbuster"
"handing them to us, ""but it's all we got"
"as of now, apart from a few sacks of gold"
"dust."" He winked at his partners. They all"
watched us as we ate the beans. Then when
we'd finished and I'd rolled a cigarette
"the man called Shorty said, ""You were saying when"
you came in that Esomep happened last.
""" Yes , "" I said . "" Something happened all right ."
"After you 'd left the meeting , mister "" - I"
"looked acress at Nick Sowd- "" romeone cut"

words affect them in their different ways .
""" That 's sure bad news , "" said Doud , sombrely ."
""" It Rjest about leares everything wide open"
"for Mr. Pell and his bunch , "" observed"
The rest of the men there said nothing but
you could see they were hard at it. They were
simple men who knew a lot maybe about
digging for gold but were babes in arms
when it came to dealing with outlaws and
desperadoes like Pell and Fenton and the
"rest . '"" I guess we 'd better hold onto the gold"
"right here, Nick , "" said the Sodbuster ."
"""Yeah,"" said Dowd dubiously. ""Maybe we'd"
"better."" Surprisingly, Dan Mattney came in at"
"that point. ""If you do,"" he said, ""you'll be"
sure asking for trouble. They'll be on your
necks before you can say 'knife.' It wouldn't
be the first time they've held up a diggings
at gunpoint either. They're done it before
"and got away with it."""

"called Roper Smith. "" We 're got five riders among"

I ain't Educated in shootin': It'd be a

"on getting your gold to the bank, then we'll"
"abide by what we said at the meeting,"""
"said Dan. "" We'll watch the stage out of reach."""
I couldn't quite see how all this fitted in
with Dan Maffrey's aim to arrange himself
on the Fenton bunch but still it was a
"handsome offer so I chimed in too . "" That"
"goes for me, gentlemen,"" I said. "" If they do try"
"and hold up the stage, it'll be a couple or"
"three of them, no more. I reckon we can deal"
