upward and shook his head slowly from
a superfluos precaution for there was no other car
abroad ; and no pedestrian to cross his path nor to wait
at an intersedia for the light to change . At his

listening in the night . Listening in vain . For the

Steve awakened early and switched on
"the radio, which he kept tuned to CB0."
The set lighted-up but gave only a low
buzzing sound. He had just finished

that they use Dan as a specimen demonstra-

working out . It occured to Steve that this may
not have been entirely an objective suggestion
on her part ; but he thought it a good idea
So they proceeded to see if the coast
was clear. The street was quiet and
deserted and there were neither sight
nor sound of flying saucers so they
ventured forth and made their way on
foot to Dan's house. Dan came
to the door at their ring but neglected
to offer any greeting. He was deeply
"preoccupied, and it seemed that the"
ringing of a doorbell was to him
a new and strange phenomenon -
"When he finally beckoned to them to enter , the action"
gave the impression of having been thought out and
"decided upon . Inside they sat down usibides , while"
Dan paced the flour . He seemed completely unaware
"of their presence . They just stared at him , turning"
their heads like tennis spectators as he walked up and
His whole attitude was a mixture of
impatience pending an awaited
communication and of a vague
perplexity respecting his surroundings
and the purpose he was to serve .

"But not for long, for scompedestrians and cars flocked upon"
the Avenue from its many tributary streets. It might have
"been a normal business-day bustle, except for two anomalies."
"First, it was Sunday morning, and, second, everyone"
"watched, or drove, or waited as a person possessed of"
a single all-exclusive purpose.
After a long wait a bus appeared and they
"followed the beaming Nen aboard , taking"
seats some rows behind him . She was

Then he would go back to Pato for a final spell of
real days and would return to New York in late
January or early February . Angelina might be a
little sorry if we were not back for Christ mas

Mortimer was a bachelor M his life he had
been inclined to regard women as something
which must necessarily be subordinated to his
career. Now he realised that he was entrusting not only
"his own wife, but Geoffrey's as well, to a strange girl"
whom he had never met and on whom after no more
than a couple of telephone calls he was
prepared to place complete reliance.
It was a novel expertence. Hlastar was
quite unable to explain why he should feel
so much confidence in her. Once again
she checked bach her instructions. It was
obvious that she did not fail to appreciate the
faith which he was placing in her and
was prepared to accept the responsibility.

make a direct comparison between the radar

"particular area within its range, Geoffrey"
turned the scale slowly to cover the
ground immediately ahead.
"He was able to pick out towns, unrecognisable to the"
"naked eye, obscured by the groand hate which even"
on the clearest night limited angular vision. He glanced
at the speed recorder. It seemed almost incredible that
the ting white figure of 8.5 against which the needle
was resting could really mean hundreds of knots.

Buh is the life of a naval effecer's wife.
John's father had been a naval officer of the old
sool; some of his rigid ideas had been passed
on to the second generation. One of these was that
"an officer should join a ship, on taking up a"
"new appointment, at nine am. precisely, dressed"
in the modern equivalent of froc-coat and sword.
But would have been acceptable to all concerned
if John had stepped into fort Blokhouse clad in

went in search of a drink. The lower bar was

Searneed's memory was prodigious; her manner
must have been worth a great deal to the proprietors
"of the hard. She greeted Jahn, however, with less"
than her usual cordiality and flashed a warning
glance at him. Evidently the other occupant
of the bar was not persona grata. If her
"money was good, so was this stranger's"
"""You're Commander Winter,"" he said. 'Tave a"

An hour's riding brought us to a trail that
we allured would lead to the miners camp .
We turned north into it and after about for
miles it led into a small canyon which
opened out into a wide shallow draw .
Here in a dried-up creek-bed we found
the miners at work . They were scattered

I saw several men running down towards
the shak. They were all armed with rifles.

"Doud, still wearing his blue check shirt. He"
"came up close, eyeing us suspiciously. ""We ve"

you may as well stay a while.
"Light an' come on in . "" We dismounted and"
one of the miners who'd come along with
Nick Noud took our horses off the water
We followed Nick into the shack .
They d rigged up a store of sorts and on it
a huge blackened coffee- pot steamed . Other
miners followed in at our heels . Nick Doud
found us a couple of boxes to sit on .
A small man in bib overalls and a battered

the little hombre in big overalls . Very soon he
had tin mugs filled with hot black coffee
sweetened with molasses for all and for us
there were two plates of beans

"handing them to us , "" but it 's all we got"
"as of now , apart from a few sacks of gold"

words affect them in their different ways.
"""That's sure bad news,"" said Doud, sombrely."
"""It Rjest about leaves everything wide open"
"for Mr. Pell and his bunch,"" observed"
The rest of the men there said nothing but
you could see they were hard it. They were
simple men who knew a lot maybe about
digging for gold but were babes in arms
when it came to dealing with oulhooters and
desperadoes like Pell and Fenton and the
"rest . '"" I guess we 'd better hold onto the gold"
"right 2hyar, Nick, "" said the Sodbuster."

with Dan Maffrey's aim to arrange himself
on the Fenton bunch but still it was a
"handsome offer so I chimed in too . "" That"
